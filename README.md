# Smart-Charging-System-Parking-based-Iot-project
 This project aims to address the scarcity of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Indian cities by introducing an IoT-based web application. By seamlessly integrating hardware components like Arduino Uno, NodeMCU, UV sensor, and an LCD display, EV owners can easily locate, book, and utilize charging stations.
